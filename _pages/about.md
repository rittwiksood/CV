Hello, I'm Rittwik. I am a PhD applicant and a Graduate student in ECE at Purdue University. I have undertaken relevant courses such as Random Variables and Stochiastic Process, Digital Communications, Computer Communication Networks and Wireless Communication Theory. I am looking to widen my horizon in the field of Wireless Communication Systems, especially Next-G Systems / THz networks. I have also worked as a TA for 'Basic Electrical Networks' ECE 2K1, and currently TAing ECE342 Signals and Systems.

I have worked as a Senior Sofware Engineer in Modem NR5G RF team on Physical Layer at Hyderabad, India. I have worked with this team for a duration of 5 years and was the juniormost team member at the conception of the team back in Oct 2018. Worked across geographies and various OEM's to cater to their different requirements and feature requests in NR5G tech, Sub6 and mmWave Communication. I also gathered some initial experience on Next-G Commuunication Systems.

I have obtained my undergrad degree from National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, in Electronics and Communication Engineering, where I have topped the entire branch and the batch of 2014-2018. I was awarded with **President of India Gold Medal** for obtaining Rank 1 in the entire institute. I got the opportunity to intern at IIT Delhi and KIT, Karlsruhe Germany during my sophomore and third year respectively. I have written few conference publications, journal publications and have an Indian patent.

My favourite passtime is travelling across places, creating plays, and reading history.
