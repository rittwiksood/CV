Hello, I'm Rittwik. I am a PhD scholar in ECE at Purdue University under the guidance of Prof. Kim Kwang. I have undertaken relevant courses such as Random Variables and Stochiastic Process and Wireless Communication Theory. I am looking to widen my horizon in the field of Wireless Communication Systems, especially Next-G Systems / THz networks. I also work as a TA for 'Basic Electrical Networks' ECE 2K1.

I have worked as a Senior Sofware Engineer in Modem NR5G RF team at Hyderabad, India. I have worked with this team for a duration of 5 years and was the juniormost team member at the conception of the team back in Oct 2018. Worked acros geographies and various OEM's to cater to their different requirements and feature requests in NR5G tech.

I have obtained my undergrad degree from National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, in Electronics and Communication Engineering, where I have topped the entire branch and the batch of 2014-2018. I got the opportunity to intern at IIT Delhi and KIT, Karlsruhe Germany during my sophomore and third year respectively. I have written few conference publications, journal publications and have an Indian patent.

My favourite passtime is travelling across places, creating plays, and reading history.
